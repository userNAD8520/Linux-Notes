# Linux-Notes
Yo wassup
These are my notes for Nathan's Linux Class. I know his notes are ahh and have little to no examples with barely any explanations so these notes provide you with a better understanding of concepts. I took the material from Nathan's notes on GitLab and enhanced it with more examples and more explainations
